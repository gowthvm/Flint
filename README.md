# Flint — Windows-native Bootable USB & Disk Image Writer

Write disk images to USB drives on Windows 10/11, then verify that every byte was written correctly.

**Current release: 2.0.0** — durable deployment campaigns, safe resumable
writes, bounded multi-drive deployment, audit reports, clone read-back
verification, and structured boot-confidence diagnostics.

Flint writes disk images (ISO, IMG, DD) to USB drives on Windows 10/11, then
reads the drive back and verifies that every byte was written correctly — so
you can trust the result before you boot from it. It needs no installation
(a portable `flint.exe`, or one `pip install`), and it never touches a drive
until you confirm the target by typing its serial number. The same engine is
available as a fully scriptable command line for power users and IT teams.

*Flashing an ISO: the image is hashed up front, the target drive is confirmed
by typing its serial, and the drive is read back after the write.*

## Features

- **One-click flash** — drag & drop or browse for an image; a SHA-256 checksum
  is computed automatically to confirm the file isn't corrupted.
- **Drive safety** — every detected USB drive is listed by model, size, and
  serial; you must type the serial before any write or wipe.
- **Verify after write** — optionally re-reads the entire drive and compares
  it byte-for-byte against the source image, reporting the exact location of
  any mismatch.
- **Bad-block scan** — retries unreadable sectors up to three times and
  reports any that permanently fail, so a faulty drive is caught before it
  matters.
- **Expert mode** — choose the partition scheme (GPT / MBR), target firmware
  (UEFI / Legacy BIOS), filesystem (FAT32 / NTFS / exFAT), and write strategy
  (raw byte-for-byte image or file copy).
- **Persistence** — keep changes across reboots on a Linux live USB stick.
  **Windows To Go** — build a portable Windows drive from an installation ISO.
- **Backup & clone** — image a USB drive to a file, or copy one drive
  byte-for-byte to another; both are verified by read-back.
- **Wipe** — securely erase a drive with zero-fill, a single random pass
  (NIST SP 800-88 clear), or a three-pass DoD 5220.22-M overwrite; the final
  pattern is always confirmed by reading the drive back.
- **Checksum sidecars** — a `.sha256` file next to your image is validated
  before flashing; a mismatch blocks the write.
- **Flash history** — every operation is logged with an exportable report.
- **Headless mode** — every feature is also a CLI command — `list`, `flash`,
  `verify`, `scan`, `wipe`, `backup`, `clone`, `queue`, `flash-all`,
  `deploy`, `report`,
  `doctor`, `completions` — with machine-readable output and documented exit
  codes for scripts and CI.
- **Portable or pip** — run `flint.exe` with no install, or
  `pip install flint-usb` on a machine with Python 3.10+.

Flint's edge is confidence: it reads the drive back after every write and
verifies the result, where most tools stop at "wrote the file." The full
walkthrough is on the [comparison page](https://flintweb.vercel.app/compare).

## Download & install

### Portable executable

- [Latest release](https://github.com/gowthvm/Flint/releases/latest) — download
  `flint.exe`. No installer, no dependencies, no telemetry.
- Windows 10/11, 64-bit. Runs elevated, so Windows may ask for administrator
  permission on every launch.

> **SmartScreen warning.** The executable is currently unsigned, so Windows
> may show a "Windows protected your PC" dialog on first run. This is expected
> for unsigned open-source builds — click **More info → Run anyway**. Verify
> the download against the published SHA-256 checksum first:
>
> ```powershell
> certutil -hashfile flint.exe SHA256
> ```
>
> Compare the result with `flint.exe.sha256` on the release page.

<details>
<summary><strong>Install via pip</strong> (Python 3.10+ or later, 64-bit)</summary>

Windows users with Python 3.10+ can install Flint from PyPI. Because pip
generates the launcher locally, there is no SmartScreen warning and no
download verification needed:

```powershell
pip install flint-usb
```

> **If `flint` is not recognized:** Python's Scripts directory is not on your
> PATH. Run this once to fix it:
> ```powershell
> $scripts = python -c "import sysconfig; print(sysconfig.get_path('scripts'))"
> [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:Path;$scripts", "User")
> ```
> New terminals only — restart the terminal after running it.

This installs a GUI and a CLI:

```powershell
flint          # open the GUI
flintw         # GUI without console window
flint --help   # CLI usage
```

pip pulls in PyQt6, psutil, pywin32, and wmi as dependencies. On first run
Flint prompts for administrator privileges automatically. The native writer
extension is compiled into the wheel for full write performance.

</details>

## Quick start

1. **Pick an image** — drag & drop an ISO/IMG file onto the drop zone, or
   click it to browse (Ctrl+O). A SHA-256 checksum is computed immediately.
2. **Choose the target drive** — click the drive card; model, size, and serial
   are shown (F5 rescans).
3. **Flash** — confirm the target by typing the drive serial or name when
   prompted, then it writes and re-reads the drive to verify the result.

Flint runs elevated and asks for administrator permission when started. Every
write and wipe is permanent — the typed confirmation is what prevents
overwriting the wrong drive.

## Safety & limitations

- 64-bit Windows only.
- Flint writes images directly to disks — this **permanently erases all data**
  on the target. Always confirm the target drive and back up important data.
- When file-copy mode targets a FAT32 drive, Flint refuses images that contain
  files over 4 GiB (FAT32 cannot store them) unless you switch the filesystem
  to NTFS or exFAT.
- Flash history is stored locally on your machine.

## Operations

<details>
<summary><strong>Verification</strong></summary>

- **Verify after write** re-reads the drive after writing (streaming SHA-256,
  live speed and remaining time).
- **Verify using SHA-256** compares the read-back digest against the image and
  reports the offsets of any mismatched regions, so a bad flash is a located,
  reported event.
- **Bad-block scan** retries failed reads up to the configured number of times
  (default 3) and reports the 4 KiB-aligned offsets of sectors that never read
  back; unreadable chunks are skipped so the rest of the image is still checked.
- **Checksum sidecars** — if a `*.sha256` file sits next to your image
  (`ubuntu.iso.sha256` or `ubuntu.sha256`), Flint reads it, verifies the image
  digest against it, and shows the result under the image source. A mismatch
  blocks flashing — a corrupt or wrong image can never erase a drive by
  accident.
- On mismatch, Flint offers to retry the write or abort. A cancelled
  verification is reported as completed-but-unverified — never as a false
  success.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Expert mode</strong></summary>

Expert mode is enabled by default and can be turned off with the toggle on the
Flash screen. It adds:

- **Partition scheme** (GPT / MBR / Auto), **target system** (UEFI / Legacy /
  Auto), and **filesystem** (FAT32 / NTFS / exFAT).
- **Write mode**: raw (DD) or file-copy. File-copy mode repartitions and
  formats the drive, then copies the image contents onto it. It is
  Windows-only, requires elevation, and is skipped for hybrid ISOs, which are
  always written raw so their boot record survives.
- **Buffer size** for raw writes (4–64 MiB) and an optional **native writer**
  using unbuffered disk I/O for maximum throughput.
- **Persistence** (Linux) and **Windows To Go** (Windows) options — see below.
- Inline **?** buttons beside every option open the in-app reference.

> **Security warning:** every option on this panel repartitions or rewrites a
> physical drive. Wrong combinations can make a drive unbootable or erase it
> without recovery. Only use these options when you know what your target
> firmware and bootloader require; back up data first.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Persistence & Windows To Go</strong></summary>

- **Persistence** keeps changes between reboots on live Linux sticks (Ubuntu
  `casper-rw`, Debian live overlay). It requires an ext4 formatting tool such
  as WSL's `mke2fs` or a native `mke2fs`/`makefs` binary.
- **Windows To Go** applies a Windows installation ISO to the drive so it boots
  as a portable Windows installation (requires NTFS and elevation).
- Both features require file-copy mode, are mutually exclusive, and are only
  shown for supported images.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Back up, clone & wipe</strong></summary>

- **Back up** (drive picker → "Backup this drive to an image…") streams a USB
  drive into a `.img` file, locking the drive's volumes while reading. The
  backup's SHA-256 is shown in the completion report.
- **Clone** (drive picker → "Clone this drive to another…") copies a drive
  onto a second drive byte-for-byte. The target must be at least as large as
  the source, must be a different drive, and requires the same typed
  confirmation as a flash.
- **Wipe** methods (the ▾ menu next to "Wipe drive"):
  - **Zero fill (fast)** — single pass of zeros
  - **Random data (NIST SP 800-88 clear)** — single pass of random data
  - **DoD 5220.22-M** — zeros, then ones, then random data (three passes)

Every wipe ends with a read-back pass that confirms the final pattern; a wipe
that cannot be verified is reported as failed, and the result is recorded in
history.

</details>

## Headless mode

Every feature is available headless (command-line only, no GUI) for imaging
labs, scripts, and CI. In the examples below, `flint` is the CLI — whether
from the downloaded `flint.exe` or the pip-installed launcher. Commands that
need it relaunch elevated automatically (one UAC prompt); `list`, `doctor`,
and `completions` need no privileges at all. The older `--cli` flag is still
accepted as a compatibility alias:

```text
flint list
flint flash  --image image.iso --drive E: --confirm <serial> [--verify]
flint verify --drive E: [--sha256 <hex> --image image.iso]
flint scan   --drive E: [--retries <1-10>]
flint wipe   --drive E: --confirm <serial> [--method zero|random|nist|dod]
flint backup --drive E: --out backup.img [--confirm <serial>]
flint clone  --from E: --to F: --confirm <serial of --to>
flint queue  --file list.txt --drive E: --confirm <serial>
flint flash-all --image image.iso [--image image2.iso ...] --confirm ARM [--timeout <seconds>]
flint deploy --image image.iso --drive E: --drive F: --confirm ARM [--parallel 2]
flint report --integrity
flint doctor
flint completions | Out-File -Append $PROFILE
flint help [<command>]
```

- `--drive` accepts a serial number, volume letter (`E:`), or physical path
  (`\\.\PHYSICALDRIVE1`); it only selects the drive. `--confirm` is the safety
  check: it must match the full serial of the drive being destroyed, validated
  against the live drive list — a wrong serial can never match another drive.
  `flint list` prints every detected drive with the exact serial `--confirm`
  expects.
- `flash-all` is fleet mode: it writes every `--image` to every drive that is —
  or becomes — plugged in, until the time budget expires (default 3600 s).
  Arming requires the literal word `ARM`.
- `deploy` writes one image to explicit target drives as a durable campaign.
  Targets run with bounded concurrency (default 2), are tracked independently,
  and produce per-target NDJSON state records with `--json`. Use `--parallel`
  to set concurrency from 1 to 8; use `queue` when writing multiple images to
  one drive.
- `report --integrity` verifies the tamper-evident chain for audited operation
  records; `report --out history.json` exports the local history store.
- Audit records use a stable operation schema: `timestamp`, `operation`,
  `success`, `verified`, target identity, duration, source/image digest when
  available, error details, and optional boot or wipe evidence. Audited records
  also carry `integrity_prev` and `integrity_sha256`; `report --integrity`
  detects edits and reordering.
- Boot checks report layout evidence with an explicit `valid`, `warning`, or
  `failed` status. They are diagnostics, not a guarantee that every firmware
  implementation will boot the drive.
- `flash` also accepts `--resume` (continue an interrupted write from where it
  left off), `--check-fake` (probe for counterfeit capacity), `--bypass-tpm`,
  `--dry-run` (preview without writing), and `--quiet`. See `flint flash --help`
  or the [CLI reference](https://flintweb.vercel.app/cli) for the full list.
- When `--confirm` is omitted on an interactive terminal, the serial is
  prompted for; a piped command without `--confirm` is refused, never guessed.
- `verify` without a digest runs a read-only bad-block scan (equivalent to
  `flint scan`); with `--sha256` it compares only the image's byte range
  against the drive, so `--image` is required to know how many bytes to check.
- The queue file holds one image path per line (`#` comments allowed); images
  are flashed to the same drive in order, stopping on the first failure.
- `--json` switches all output to NDJSON (progress, results, drive lists,
  doctor reports); `FLINT_PROGRESS=json` is equivalent and `FLINT_VERIFY=1`
  makes `flash` verify by default.
- **Streams are split:** data and the final `RESULT ok|fail|cancelled: …` line
  go to stdout; `FLINT <pct> <speed>MB/s ETA <sec>s` progress and notes go to
  stderr, so scripts capture stdout as pure data without `2>&1` noise.
- Exit codes: `0` OK, `1` failure, `2` cancelled, `3` usage/validation error,
  `4` elevation denied.
- Persistent deployment jobs can be inspected and controlled after a restart:
  `flint deploy --status`, `flint deploy --cancel --job <id>`, and
  `flint deploy --retry --job <id>`. Run or resume a job with
  `flint deploy --run --job <id>`. Retry is allowed only for failed,
  cancelled, or resumable jobs and never bypasses target identity checks.
- `flint completions --shell powershell|bash|zsh` prints a shell completion
  script (commands, options, and live drive serials); for example
  `flint completions --shell bash | tee ~/.bashrc`.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Windows protected your PC"** — expected for unsigned builds. Verify the
  checksum, then click **More info → Run anyway**.
- **`flint` is not recognized after pip install** — Python's Scripts directory
  is not on your PATH; run the PATH-fix snippet in [Download & install](#download--install).
- **"Drive path unavailable"** — the drive was disconnected or re-enumerated;
  refresh (F5) and re-pick it.
- **Flash succeeded but verification failed** — re-flash once. If it fails
  again at the same offsets, the drive is likely failing hardware or
  counterfeit capacity; replace it.

The complete symptom guide lives in the
[manual's troubleshooting section](https://flintweb.vercel.app/docs#troubleshoot).

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11 (64-bit) — Flint is Windows-native (uses pywin32, wmi, and
  raw disk access).
- Python 3.10–3.13 (64-bit).
- Git for Windows.
- A C compiler (Visual Studio Build Tools or MSVC) to optionally build the
  native writer extension. Without it, Flint falls back to a pure-Python write
  path automatically.

### Setup

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/gowthvm/Flint.git
cd Flint

python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Then build the optional native writer extension:

```powershell
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

This compiles `core/_native_writer.c` into a `.pyd` in `core/`. If compilation
fails, the build is tolerated and Flint uses the pure-Python fallback.

### Quality gates

Run these before opening a PR — they mirror CI exactly:

```powershell
# Lint
ruff check .

# Type check
mypy core ui main.py --ignore-missing-imports

# Tests (full suite, a few minutes)
python -m pytest -q
```

### Building the standalone exe

```powershell
pip install pyinstaller==6.22.0
python -m PyInstaller --clean --noconfirm flint.spec
```

Produces `dist\flint.exe` — a single-file, UAC-admin, windowed build. The spec
bundles `ui/reference.html` and `ui/flint.ico`, includes pywin32/wmi/psutil
hidden imports, and auto-includes the native writer `.pyd` if present.

## Contributing

1. **Fork & branch** off `main`. Use a descriptive branch name
   (`fix/drive-detection`, `feat/ntfs-label`).
2. **Install all dependencies** (runtime + dev) and build the native extension
   as shown above.
3. **Write or update tests** for any new functionality or bug fix. Tests live
   in `tests/` and are named `test_<module>.py`.
4. **Run the full gate suite** before pushing:
   ```powershell
   ruff check .
   mypy core ui main.py --ignore-missing-imports
   python -m pytest -q
   ```
   All three must pass.
5. **Open a PR** against `main`. CI runs the same gates on Windows with Python
   3.11.

**What to include in a PR:**

- Code changes with passing tests.
- Updated docstrings or help text if user-facing behavior changed.
- A changelog-ready description (even if you don't edit the changelog).

**Avoid:**

- Unpinned dependency bumps (pin versions and re-run the gates).
- Secrets, keys, or signing credentials in code or commits.
- Changes to `flint-web/` unless directly related to your feature.
